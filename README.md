# Customer Churn Prediction

In the context of a classification problem, I orchestrated a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline, employing meticulous techniques to enhance data quality. My expertise extended to data visualization, where I harnessed the power of visualization libraries to gain critical insights.

For feature selection, I meticulously employed various methodologies to identify the most influential variables. The heart of the project lay in crafting and fine-tuning a suite of classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC).

An exhaustive comparison of these models was conducted, revealing their respective strengths and weaknesses. The ultimate objective was to provide actionable insights and make precise predictions for this classification problem, facilitating data-driven decision-making.


The training dataset contains 4250 samples. Each sample contains 19 features and 1 boolean variable "churn" which indicates the class of the sample. The 19 input features and 1 target variable are:

"state", string. 2-letter code of the US state of customer residence "account_length", numerical. Number of months the customer has been with the current telco provider "area_code", string="area_code_AAA" where AAA = 3 digit area code. "international_plan", (yes/no). The customer has international plan. "voice_mail_plan", (yes/no). The customer has voice mail plan. "number_vmail_messages", numerical. Number of voice-mail messages. "total_day_minutes", numerical. Total minutes of day calls. "total_day_calls", numerical. Total minutes of day calls. "total_day_charge", numerical. Total charge of day calls. "total_eve_minutes", numerical. Total minutes of evening calls. "total_eve_calls", numerical. Total number of evening calls. "total_eve_charge", numerical. Total charge of evening calls. "total_night_minutes", numerical. Total minutes of night calls. "total_night_calls", numerical. Total number of night calls. "total_night_charge", numerical. Total charge of night calls. "total_intl_minutes", numerical. Total minutes of international calls. "total_intl_calls", numerical. Total number of international calls. "total_intl_charge", numerical. Total charge of international calls "number_customer_service_calls", numerical. Number of calls to customer service "churn", (yes/no). Customer churn - target variable.
